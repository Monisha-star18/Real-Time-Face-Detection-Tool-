Project Description: Face Detection System

Project Details
This project implements a real-time face detection system using OpenCV. It utilizes Haar cascades to detect human faces and eyes from live webcam footage. 
The system continuously processes frames captured from the webcam, converts them to grayscale, and applies the Haar cascade classifiers to identify faces and eyes. 
Detected faces and eyes are highlighted using bounding boxes.

Tools Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:
OpenCV (cv2) – for image processing and face detection
Haarcascades – pre-trained models for face and eye detection

Hardware Requirement: A webcam for real-time detection
